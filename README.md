# LinuxOS

Developed a Linux-like operating system in a team of four to get a deeper understanding of how software is used to
interface between devices and applications.

Implemented the interrupt descriptor table, memory paging, i8259 PIC interrupt handling, exception handling, system
call interface, read-only file system, multiple terminals, and round-robin scheduling.
